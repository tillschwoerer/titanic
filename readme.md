This is a demo project for practicing Git and Github

On Monday we did some basic git workflows.

```
git add
git commit
git branch
git merge
git reset
```

Today, Wednesday, we cover (1) a review quiz, and (2) collaborative workflows:

- Forking Workflow (Open Source Project Setting)
- Feature Branch Workflow (Company Setting)
